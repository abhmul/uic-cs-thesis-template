\section{Conditional Expectation}
\label{stoch:cexpe}

Suppose we are given a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{B}, \mathbb{P})\) and a random variable \(X \in L^{1}(\mathcal{B})\). We would like to describe the operation of "viewing" this random variable from a sub-sigma algebra \(\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{B}\). We call this operation \textit{conditional expectation} and define it as follows:



The Ramones are a great band from \gls{nyc}.  Probably even better than you
remember. There have been books written about them, like ``Hey Ho Let's Go: The
Story of the Ramones: The Story of The Ramones''~\cite{true2010hey} and ``Jews,
punk and the Holocaust: from the Velvet Underground to the Ramones--the
Jewish-American story''~\cite{stratton2005jews}.

As \ref{fig:logo} shows, they had a great logo too.  And they wrote amazing
albums, like \gls{rtr} and \gls{eofc}, and a couple more.  They even did
three (!) jingles for Steel Reserve\footnote{The gross malt liquor.}
