We will first set up some of the basic probability concepts needed to define martingales. We will establish conditional expectation, but take most of the basic results and relevant measure theoretic results for granted. From there, we will turn to martingales and start with studying "strategies" on martingales and how they help us prove convergence. In addition, we will look into decomposition of processes in terms of martingales. Finally, we will look at an example application of martingales to study the number of components in an Erdős-Rényi graph.
