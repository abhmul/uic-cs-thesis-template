\acknowledgment

I'd first and foremost like to acknowledge Dr. Will Perkins for all his mentorship and encouragement throughout this year. Without him, I don't think this year would have been as successful as it has been. He helped get me started in graduate level mathematics by approving an independent study during Fall 2021. That helped build my confidence in my ability to learn math on my own outside the classroom.

I'd like to thank Dr. Gyorgy Turan, Dr. Natasha Devroye, and Dr. Milos Zefran for serving as research mentors. Under their guidance, I have become a published researcher and found ways to blend my past experience with my interests in math.

I'd also like to give a shout-out to Dr. Gyorgy Turan, Dr. Julius Ross, and Maureen Madden for helping me map out my Master's degree and my path to becoming a PhD student. Dr. Lindsay Marshall was also an immense help with preparing my application materials and essays. Without her, my essays would not have captured the messages I was trying to convey.

And of course, I'd like to thank my committee members, Dr. Will Perkins, Dr. Marcus Michelen, and Dr. Cheng Ouyang, for taking time out of their days to help me complete my degree.
